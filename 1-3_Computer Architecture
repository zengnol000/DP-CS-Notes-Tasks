A computer's RAM is the temporary memory of the computer, which is freed when the window is closed or the machine loses power. The HDD and SSD stores the data permanently but the drives are slower than RAM in retrieving data. The computer fan actively cools the inside of the computer case. The thermal paste conducts heat and serves as an interface between the heat sinks and heat sources. Computer case holds the PC components and provides structure and protection. The computer also contains a video card which is a dedicated unit for the computer's display. GPUs have their own dedicated RAM to perform their visual functions. The I/O shield aka the RFI/EMI cover plate keeps EM radiation inside the case and keeps dust outside of the case.
